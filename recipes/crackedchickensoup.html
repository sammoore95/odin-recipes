    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Cracked chicken soup is bursting with all the best flavors! It starts with
      softened vegitables and crumbled bacon... the perfect base for any soup.
      Then add in shredded chicken, cream cheese, ranch seasoning, and sour
      cream for all that creamy flavor. Finish it off with shredded cheddar
      cheese and spinach. This soup is creamy, comforting, and incredibly tasty!
