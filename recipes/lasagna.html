    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Lasagna is often thought of as a complicated dish to make, but fear not, this
        Lasagna recipe simplifies the steps and makes it easy! Lasagna is a classic baked pasta
        dish featuring layers of thin, wide pasta (lasagna noodles) alternating with rich meat
        sauce (ragu), cheese (ricotta, mozzarella, parmesan), and often tomato sauce.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li><span>&#189</span> teaspoon kosher salt</li> <!-- &#189 code for half fraction -->
        <li><span>&#188</span> teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li> <!-- &#188 code for quarter fraction -->
        <li>1 jar marinara sauce (3 cups)</li>
        <li>12 ounces low- moisture mozzarella cheese, shredded (about 3 cups), divided</li>
        <li>15 dry lasagna noodles, divided</li>
        <li>16 ounces whole-milk ricotta cheese, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat the oven to 400<span>&#176</span>F. <!-- &#176 is degree symbol code -->
        </li>
        <li>
            Finely chop 1 medium yellow onion. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a 12-inch or larger
            regular or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering.
            Add the onion, 1 pound lean ground beef, <span>&#189</span> teaspoon kosher salt,
            and <span>&#188</span> teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, and cook, breaking the 
            beef up into small pieces with wooden spoon, until the beef is cooked through, 
            6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool for 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Open 1 jar marinara sauce (3 cups). Spread a thin layer of the sauce in the 
            bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Stir the remaining sauce into the ground 
            beef mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Shred 12 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese if needed (3 cups). Place 5 lasagna 
            noodles in the baking dish, breaking them if needed to create a single layer (it's 
            OK if the noodles overlap slightly). Dollop and spread 1 cup of the ricotta cheese over 
            the noodles. Dollop and spread about 1 <span>&#189</span> cups of the meat sauce 
            on the ricotta, then sprinkle with 1 cup of mozzarella.
        </li>
        <li>
            Arrange 5 more noodles over the mozzarella, followed by 1 cup of the ricotta 
            cheese, 1 <span>&#189</span> cups of the meat sauce, and 1 cup of the mozzarella. 
            Top with a final layer of 5 noodles and the remaining sauce, spreading the sauce 
            thin so that it almost completely covers the noodles. (Reserve the remaining 1 cup 
            mozzarella for the end of baking). Cover the dish.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake for 1 hour. Check to make sure the noodles are done by poking the 
            lasagna with a knife; the knife should slide easily through all the layers. 
            If it doesn't, cover and cook for 15 minutes more.
        </li>
        <li>
            Uncover the lasagna and sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup mozzarella. Bake 
            uncovered until the mozzarella is melted and lightly browned, and the sauce 
            is bubbling, 8 to 10 minutes more.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let the lasagna cool on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes before serving.
